# Internship_Database

Project Team: Ragy Costa de jesus, Ben Heins, and Kaden Carr

Project Description: This internship database is a product that will allow a student at Florida Gulf Coast University who is looking for an internship to 
                     search through this database and find themselves an internship that fits their future career. The database shall store an internship 
                     that has been processed and approved by the internship department of the Whitaker College of Engineering. The software will contain vital 
                     information to determine if the student is fit for the respective internship. This software will utilize PyCharm to create table relations 
                     and tables and allow for an easy transition when designing a UI.
